# Decidable
This is my portion of code written for the group project "Decidable" made for Google's CSSI (I was in charge of python and javscript, and assisted with .yaml and .html files).

The final project is available here: http://decidable-plus.appspot.com/

The full code (including work done by my teammates or the group as a whole) is available here: https://github.com/smurfyswag/courage

Note: The code in this repository was designed to run in conjunction with the HTML and CSS files that are part of "Decidable." It exists here only to serve as an example of my programming.
